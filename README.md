Ludum Dare 43 - TBD
============================

LD43 Entry by Jimbly

* Using [Javascript libGlov/GLOV.js framework](https://github.com/Jimbly/turbulenz-playground)

Start with: `npm start` (after running `npm i` once)

TODO:
* Would be useful to see current stats of all potions (and pets) - roll over something and they all show up? Always there? Hold shift?

Polish
* Tutorial or more instruction - Help button with flow-chart?
* Sounds / Music
  * Sacrifice squish
  * Brew burble
* Pets wander when mouse not near them
* Pets smoothly move from position to position, including from store purchase window
* Quick animation up clicking Brew

Graphics
* Shadows under pets
* Animate pets
* More pet variety and size variety - why?  Just make slimes better? and we're a Slime Slaughterer?
* Gears or pattern in background of pipes board

Stretch
* Pets grow in size after being fed?  Or their size is fixed?
